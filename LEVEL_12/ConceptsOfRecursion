A function which calls itself directly or indirectly is known as a Recursive Function. Recursion is a very powerful approach as it solves certain problems easily for example Depth First Search, Tower of Hanoi, Sudokus and Crosswords etc.</br>
In Recursion solution to a bigger problem is attained by thinking and expressing it in terms of a smaller problem and this smaller problem is tackled by the Base case.</br>
Base Case is where the Recursion ends. Without the base case (that is the base case is not defined or is not reached) the recurive function may lead to Stack Overflow.</br>
Stack Overflow is usually encountered more often in JAVA as compared to C++ because the size of stack in JAVA is less as compared to that of C++. This is primarily because of the fact that JAVA uses a virtual environment.</br>
