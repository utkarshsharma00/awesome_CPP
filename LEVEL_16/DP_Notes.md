Dynamic programming helps to solve a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those sub-problems just once, and storing their solutions.

A dynamic programming algorithm will examine the previously solved sub problems and will combine their solutions to give the best solution for the given problem.

It is used when the solution can be recursively described in terms of solutions to subproblems (optimal substructure).

Optimal substructure: optimal solution to problem consists of optimal solutions to subproblems.
Overlapping subproblems: few subproblems in total, many recurring instances of each.
Solve bottom-up, building a table of solved subproblems that are used to solve larger ones.
